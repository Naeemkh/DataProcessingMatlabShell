\section{Setup a data processing package}

In many cases, using MATLAB in Unix improves the efficiency and accuracy of the project (considering the fact that it eliminates human intervention). However, for a massive processing, it may be a good idea to write the core function in other programs (e.g. C++, Fortran). The following steps are necessary for all data processing packages regardless of the core function. Let's setup a data processing package to get students grades and compute the average grade for each student. We are using simple example t to get the whole structure without adding complexity in each step. The input file has some number of grades of different courses. We want to write a program to get the student's file and write student's file name, number of courses, and average grade in the output file. We also want to make sure that the data of each student, processed successfully or if there was a problem in processing, what it was. \\
